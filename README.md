# üí≥ Fraud Detection in Bank Transactions

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to detect potential fraudulent transactions in a banking dataset.  

---

## üìå Overview

With the rapid growth of digital banking, fraud detection has become a top priority for financial institutions.  
This project explores how unsupervised learning methods like **clustering** and **anomaly detection** can be used to identify suspicious transaction behavior and enhance fraud prevention systems.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source File**: `data.csv`  
- **Total Records**: **2,512 transactions**  
- **Features Include**:  
  - `TransactionAmount`, `TransactionDate`, `TransactionType` (Credit/Debit)  
  - `Location`, `DeviceID`, `IP Address`, `Channel` (ATM, Online, etc.)  
  - `AccountBalance`, `TransactionDuration`, `LoginAttempts`  
- **Data Quality**:  
  - No missing values or duplicate entries  
  - Numeric, categorical, and time-based features suitable for clustering and anomaly detection

## üéØ Project Goals

- Detect potential fraudulent activities using unsupervised machine learning techniques  
- Visualize behavioral patterns and transaction anomalies  
- Analyze transaction behavior across channels, times, locations, and devices  

---

## ü§ñ Algorithms Used

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
- Identifies natural groupings in the dataset  
- Optimal **k = 3** selected using the Elbow Method  
- Outliers (transactions far from cluster centroids) flagged as potential frauds  

### 2. **DBSCAN Clustering**
- Density-based clustering automatically detecting noise points (anomalies)  
- No need to predefine number of clusters  
- Parameters tuned: `eps = 1.5`, `min_samples = 5`  

### 3. **Isolation Forest**
- Tree-based ensemble method for anomaly detection  
- Works well in high-dimensional data  
- Flags outliers based on degree of isolation in feature space

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Distributions**: Histograms of transaction amount, duration, and account balance  
- **Correlations**: Numeric relationship analysis  
- **Category Analysis**: Pie charts and bar plots for `TransactionType`, `Channel`, etc.  
- **Behavioral Patterns**:  
  - High-frequency login attempts  
  - Transactions outside business hours  
  - Multiple accounts using same device or IP  
  - Transactions across multiple locations  
  - High-value or long-duration transactions

## üîç Anomaly Detection Models

| Algorithm        | Key Strengths                              | Output Type             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **K-Means**      | Fast, interpretable, scalable            | Cluster-based outliers  |
| **DBSCAN**       | Handles arbitrary shapes and densities    | Noise points (`-1`)     |
| **Isolation Forest** | Effective in high dimensions, robust | Binary (fraud/normal)   |

## ‚úÖ Results & Insights

- **K-Means**: Detected several statistically distant transactions  
- **DBSCAN**: Automatically identified noise points not belonging to any cluster  
- **Isolation Forest**: Flagged ~5% of records as anomalies based on isolation depth  

**Behavioral Findings**:
- Debit transactions more prone to fraud  
- Nighttime transactions more suspicious  
- Certain IPs and devices used by multiple accounts  
- Login attempts often correlated with higher fraud likelihood  

These insights can help design **real-time fraud detection systems** in practice.
